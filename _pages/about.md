Greetings, my name is Kun Shi. I am a Research Fellow in [S-Lab for Advanced Intelligence](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/s-lab) of [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Shibo He and Prof. Jiming Chen. Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology in 2018.
My research focuses on multimodal fusion, wireless sensing, and autonomous driving.

Conference
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
