Greetings, my name is Kun Shi. I am a Research Fellow in [S-Lab for Advanced Intelligence](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/s-lab) of [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Shibo He and Prof. Jiming Chen. Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology in 2018.
My research focuses on multimodal fusion, radar sensing, and autonomous driving.
